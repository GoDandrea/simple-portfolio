            <!-- Though I've lost many battles, I won a ten year war against
            depression. Through sheer tenacity I have -->
            I made a point of
            <span class="text-secondary"> learning</span>
            in college a little bit of everything of my own accord. From
            <span class="text-secondary"> AI </span>
            to
            <span class="text-secondary"> web development</span>, dipping my
            toes in <span class="text-secondary"> signal processing</span>,
            <span class="text-secondary"> computational geometry</span>,
            <span class="text-secondary"> graphical computing</span>, and going
            through the usual curriculum of
            <span class="text-secondary"> algorithm optimization</span>,
            <span class="text-secondary"> statistics</span>,
            <span class="text-secondary"> calculus</span>, and
            <span class="text-secondary"> linear algebra</span>, all of which I
            enjoyed very much, while also learning
            <span class="text-secondary"> game development </span> with my
            friends from <a href="https://usp.game.dev.br">UGD</a>. I even took
            a course on
            <span class="text-secondary"> creative writing </span> through
            Coursera back when the quarantines began.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is to say, I will and want to
            <span class="text-secondary"> learn</span>. More than that, I'm
            eager to apply this knowledge. <br />

            Never arrive unarmed to a gunfight. Problems are seldon unsolved, or
            at least much easier to deal with if when one knows the right tools
            and the right <i>math</i>. Make sure you understand the problem,
            then deal with it appropriately. And if you don't know these tools?
            Learn them. What good will one do in a gunfight without knowing how
            to use their gun?
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to be quick and know how to improvise, but more often
            than not, it's like a surgery; do what you know, lern what you must,
            minimize the collateral damage, and leave no trace. Never messy,
            always SOLID. Code is made to be read by humans, after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            On occasion, however, one may find a team using hammers to drive in
            screws. Be ready to teach them. Be ready to join them. Be ready to
            rely and be relied on.

            Colleges are (in)famously lousy at teaching programming languages.
            My experience was no different, but perhaps it was for the best; I
            don't take my knowledge of tools for granted, and I'm ready to learn
            a language, library, or framework in a moment's notice. Which is
            also why I <i>had</i> to learn both sides of the trade. How could I
            pick based on superficial impressions?
          </p>
          <p>
            How could I choose
            <i>not</i> to learn an entire half of the art?
          </p>

          <p>
            Back during high-school, I was afraid I'd have to choose between art
            and programming. When I became a programmer, I learned I could
            choose both.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a beautiful thing, to make art as a programmer. It's both work
            and hobby. Jack of all trades and master of quite a few. It takes
            effort, but its deeply rewarding. Purposeful.
          </p>
          <p>I can't imagine a world where games aren't my medium of choice.</p>
